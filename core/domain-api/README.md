# Portobello API domain objects

All domain objects for the Portobello API are stored here.

These objects must match the OpenAPI spec stored in [`core/api-spec/openapi.yml`](../api-spec/openapi.yml). If any of the structs in this crate change, [`openapi.yml`](../api-spec/openapi.yml) should also be updated.
