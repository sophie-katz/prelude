# Portobello API server routes

Declaration of all API server routes and top-level handlers for Rocket.

These routes must match the OpenAPI spec stored in [`core/api-spec/openapi.yml`](../api-spec/openapi.yml). See this file for documentation on routes. If any of the routes in this crate change, [`openapi.yml`](../api-spec/openapi.yml) should also be updated.
